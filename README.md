Machine Learning Project at YBI Foundation
Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (.pynb) for the machine learning project conducted at YBI Foundation. The project focuses on Using Jupyter Notebook, the project covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation phases. Key techniques and tools like Python's pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and visualization libraries are utilized to draw insights and build robust predictive models. The goal is to demonstrate practical applications of data science principles in solving real-world problems.
